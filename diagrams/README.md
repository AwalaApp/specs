# Diagrams

This directory contains the source and final image for the diagrams used in the Awala specs.

Each subdirectory should correspond to a spec.

## Sequence diagrams

For each sequence diagram, the following files should be provided:

- The `.png` file to be embedded in the spec.
- The `.txt` file containing the diagram source.

All sequence diagrams should be generated with [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/).
